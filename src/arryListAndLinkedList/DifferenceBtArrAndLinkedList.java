/* Notes:
 * Difference between Array List and Linked List:-
 * 	1.Array list is using Array to store data.
 * 	  Linked List is using Doubly linked list to store the data. In which, data are stored as node. Each node will
 * 	  have value and address of the next node.
 * 	2.Manipulation is slow in Array list.
 * 	  Manipulation will be fast as it is using doubly linked list concept in Linked list.
 * 	3.Array list class will act as List.
 * 	  Linked list class will act as both list and queue.
 * 	4.Array list is better for storing and accessing data.
 * 	  Linked list is better for manipulating data.
