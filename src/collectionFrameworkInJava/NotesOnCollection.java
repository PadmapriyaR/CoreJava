	/* Collection Framework is a combination of classes and Interfaces.
	 * Collection allows us to manipulate and store the group of objects.
	 * Collection Interface and classes are present in util package.
	 * Without objects we can not do anything in collection.
	 * Classes and Interfaces has its own hierarchy.
	 *                          
	 *                           -----  Set   --- Hash Set, Linked Hash Set, Tree set 
	 *                           | 
	 *                           | 
	 *                           |                      
	 * Iterable ---   Collection  ----  Map   ---- Hash Map, linked Hash Map, Tree Map
	 * 							 |
	 *                           | 
	 *                           |
	 *                           ----- List   --- Array List, Linked List, Vector
	 *                           |
	 *                           |
	 *                           |
	 *                           ----- Queue  --- Priority Queue
	 *                           
	 *  
	 *  In this above diagram, Set, Map, List, Queue are Interfaces which has extends from Collection Interface.
	 *  This collection interface has extends from Iterable Interface. Each Interface will have corresponding
	 *  classes that will implement the interface.
	 *  So, each Interface has corresponding classes that will implement interface.
	 *  Set has Hash set, Linked Hash Set, Tree set
	 *  Map has Hash Map, linked hash map, Tree map
	 *  List has Array List, vector, Linked List
	 *  Queue has Priority queue
	 *
